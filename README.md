# Knowledge's SteamLib

## Installation

My skin was made and tested on SFP, I don't use Millenium.

### Patching Steam

1. Intall [SFP](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP#readme) following its instructions.

### Applying my skin

1. Download my [latest release](https://github.com/Potato95/Knowledges-SteamLib/releases/latest).

2. In SFP, select "Open File" > skins, and extract my folder inside the folder that just opened.
- The structure here should be "steam\steamui\skins\Knowledges-SteamLib-\[version]\", with css and js files inside the last folder.

3. Go back to SFP, open its configuration menu, scroll down and activate "Inject JavaScript" (only do this for trusted sources), some UI elements won't be correctly placed and/or fixed without it.

4. Scroll up a bit. At "Steam skin" select "Knowledges-SteamLib-\[version]" and restart Steam if necessary ("Restart Steam" in SFP's Home)
